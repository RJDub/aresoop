PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
	Our project is based on the premise of a colonization attempt of the planet Mars. As such game-play will begin
	with the user having a certain number of colonists who he/she will command with directives in order to establish
	an effective colony. The objective of the game is to reach a victory condition. This is accomplished in a few different
	ways. One such way is by surviving for a certain amount of time (not currently set), another is by recruiting a
	certain amount of colonists to the colony (also not set), and a third is by reaching a certain level of economic prosperity.
	These three victory conditions can be summed up as: Survival Victory, Colonization Victory, and Economic Victory; respectively
	to the previous conditions of course. During game-play the user will face the challenges that a society attempting to colonize
	the planet would normally need to encounter, for now the colonists require certain levels of food, water, and sleep in 
	order to remain active and accomplish the tasks assigned to them. In order to meet these victory goals colonists will need
	to harness natural resources, build and expand. This will be possible due to the different game-tiles available to the colonists,
	there ability to build structures, the ability to harvest and use resources, and most importantly the ability to recruit
	new colonists to the mission. This will allow the user to interact with the game, make decisions, and ultimately test
	his/her skills to command a colony.
